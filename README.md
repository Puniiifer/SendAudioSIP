# SendAudioSIP
C# project for sending audiofile on the SIP client

For the program to work correctly, it is necessary to have access to the SIP server on which we make the call, you can check with the ping command "sip-server". The client from which the call is being made should not be active anywhere, for additional questions, refer to the SIPSorcery documentation.
